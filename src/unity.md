# Prefabs and the develop scene <img src="images/prefab_icon.png" width="35" height="35">

The develop scene is compromised of multiple prefabricated objects (prefabs for short).
They have a blue color in the hierarchy.

![Hierarchy](images/hierarchy.png)

When making changes to a prefab you need to find the object in the project files or open it from the inspecotr and do the changes there, **not in the develop scene directly**.
If the prefab contains other prefabs inside it keep opening them.
